It was invented just for the purpose of the book. Source is a sublanguage of ECMAScript 2016 (7th edition) and defined in the documents titled 'Source ยงx', where x refers to the respective textbook chapter. For example, Source ยง3 is suitable for textbook chapter 3 and the preceeding chapters. The playground comes with an editor and a REPL, on the left and right of the screen, respectively. You may customise the layout of the playground by clicking and dragging on the right border of the editor, or the top border of the REPL."
